Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
CS Core:
1. Develop algorithmic solutions to real-world societal problems, such as routing an ambulance to a
hospital.
2. Explain the impact that an algorithm may have on the environment and society when used to solve
a real-world problem while considering its sustainability and that it can affect different societal
groups in different ways.
3. Prepare a presentation that justifies the selection of appropriate data structures and/or algorithms to
solve a given real-world problem.
4. Explain an example that articulates how differential privacy protects knowledge of an individualâ€™s
data.
5. Explain the environmental impacts of design choices that relate to algorithm design.
6. Explain the tradeoffs involved in proof-of-work and proof-of-stake algorithms.
