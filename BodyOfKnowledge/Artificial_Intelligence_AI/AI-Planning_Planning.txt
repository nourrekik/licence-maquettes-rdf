AI-Planning: Planning
Non-core:
1. Review of propositional and first-order logic
2. Planning operators and state representations
3. Total order planning
4. Partial-order planning
5. Plan graphs and GraphPlan
6. Hierarchical planning
7. Planning languages and representations
a. PDDL
8. Multi-agent planning
9. MDP-based planning
10. Interconnecting planning, execution, and dynamic replanning
a. Conditional planning
b. Continuous planning
c. Probabilistic planning
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
1. Construct the state representation, goal, and operators for a given planning problem.
2. Encode a planning problem in PDDL and use a planner to solve it.
3. Given a set of operators, initial state, and goal state, draw the partial-order planning graph and
include ordering constraints to resolve all conflicts.
4. Construct the complete planning graph for GraphPlan to solve a given problem.
