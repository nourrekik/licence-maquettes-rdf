AI-LRR: Logical Representation and Reasoning
Non-core:
77
1. Review of propositional and predicate logic (See also: MSF-Discrete)
2. Resolution and theorem proving (propositional logic only)
a. Forward chaining, backward chaining
3. Knowledge representation issues
a. Description logics
b. Ontology engineering
4. Semantic web
5. Non-monotonic reasoning (e.g., non-classical logics, default reasoning)
6. Argumentation
7. Reasoning about action and change (e.g., situation and event calculus)
8. Temporal and spatial reasoning
9. Logic programming
a. Prolog, Answer Set Programming
10. Rule-based Expert Systems
11. Semantic networks
12. Model-based and Case-based reasoning
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
1. Translate a natural language (e.g., English) sentence into a predicate logic statement.
2. Convert a logic statement into clausal form.
3. Apply resolution to a set of logic statements to answer a query.
4. Compare and contrast the most common models used for structured knowledge representation,
highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.
5. Identify the components of non-monotonic reasoning and its usefulness as a representational
mechanism for belief systems.
6. Compare and contrast the basic techniques for representing uncertainty.
7. Compare and contrast the basic techniques for qualitative representation.
8. Apply situation and event calculus to problems of action and change.
9. Explain the distinction between temporal and spatial reasoning, and how they interrelate.
10. Explain the difference between rule-based, case-based, and model-based reasoning techniques.
11. Define the concept of a planning system and how it differs from classical search techniques.
12. Describe the differences between planning as search, operator-based planning, and propositional
planning, providing examples of domains where each is most applicable.
13. Explain the distinction between monotonic and non-monotonic inference.
