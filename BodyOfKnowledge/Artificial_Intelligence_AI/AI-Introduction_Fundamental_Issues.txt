b. Reflexive, goal-based, and utility-based
c. Decision making under uncertainty and with incomplete information
d. The importance of perception and environmental interactions
e. Learning-based agents
f. Embodied agents
i. sensors, dynamics, effectors
6. Overview of AI Applications, growth, and impact (economic, societal, ethics)
KA Core:
7. Practice identifying problem characteristics in example environments
8. Additional depth on nature of agents with examples
9. Additional depth on AI Applications, Growth, and Impact (economic, societal, ethics, security)
Non-core:
10. Philosophical issues
11. History of AI
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
1. Describe the Turing test and the “Chinese Room” thought experiment.
2. Differentiate between optimal reasoning/behavior and human-like reasoning/behavior.
3. Differentiate the terms: AI, machine learning, and deep learning.
4. Enumerate the characteristics of a specific problem.
