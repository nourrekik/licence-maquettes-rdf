AI-KRR: Fundamental Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
CS Core:
1. Types of representations
a. Symbolic, logical
i. Creating a representation from a natural language problem statement
b. Learned subsymbolic representations
c. Graphical models (e.g., naive Bayes, Bayesian network)
2. Review of probabilistic reasoning, Bayes theorem (See also: MSF-Probability)
3. Bayesian reasoning
a. Bayesian inference
KA Core:
4. Random variables and probability distributions
a. Axioms of probability
b. Probabilistic inference
c. Bayes’ Rule (derivation)
d. Bayesian inference (more complex examples)
5. Independence
6. Conditional Independence
7. Markov chains and Markov models
8. Utility and decision making
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
1. Given a natural language problem statement, encode it as a symbolic or logical representation.
2. Explain how we can make decisions under uncertainty, using concepts such as Bayes theorem and
utility.
3. Compute a probabilistic inference in a real-world problem using Bayes’ theorem to determine the
probability of a hypothesis given evidence.
4. Apply Bayes’ rule to determine the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.
5. Compute the probability of outcomes and test whether outcomes are independent.

AI-ML: Machine Learning
CS Core:
1. Definition and examples of a broad variety of machine learning tasks
a. Supervised learning
i. Classification
ii. Regression
b. Reinforcement learning
c. Unsupervised learning
i. Clustering
2. Fundamental ideas:
a. No free lunch theorem: no one learner can solve all problems; representational design decisions
have consequences.
b. Sources of error and undecidability
