AI-SEP: Applications and Societal Impact
Note: There is substantial benefit to studying applications and ethics/fairness/trust/explainability in a
curriculum alongside the methods and theory that they apply to, rather than covering ethics in a
separate, dedicated class session. Whenever possible, study of these topics should be integrated
alongside other modules, such as exploring how decision trees could be applied to a specific problem
in environmental sustainability such as land use allocation, then assessing the
social/environmental/ethical implications of doing so.
CS Core:
1. At least one application of AI to a specific problem and field, such as medicine, health,
sustainability, social media, economics, education, robotics, etc. (choose at least one for the CS
Core).
a. Formulating and evaluating a specific application as an AI problem
i. How to deal with underspecified or ill-posed problems
b. Data availability/scarcity and cleanliness
i. Basic data cleaning and preprocessing
ii. Data set bias
c. Algorithmic bias
d. Evaluation bias
e. Assessment of societal implications of the application
2. Deployed deep generative models
a. High-level overview of deep image generative models (e.g., as of 2023, DALL-E, Midjourney,
Stable Diffusion, etc.), their uses, and their shortcomings/pitfalls.
b. High-level overview of large language models (e.g., as of 2023, ChatGPT, Bard, etc.), their
uses, and their shortcomings/pitfalls.
3. Overview of societal impact of AI

a. Ethics (See also: SEP-Context)
b. Fairness (See also: SEP-Privacy, SEP-DEIA)
c. Trust/explainability (See also: SEP-Context)
d. Privacy and usage of training data (See also: SEP-Privacy)
e. Human autonomy and oversight/regulations/legal requirements (See also: SEP-Context)
f. Sustainability (See also: SEP-Sustainability)
KA Core:
4. One or more additional applications of AI to a broad set of problems and diverse fields, such as
medicine, health, sustainability, social media, economics, education, robotics, etc. (choose a
different area from that chosen for the CS Core).
a. Formulating and evaluating a specific application as an AI problem
i. How to deal with underspecified or ill-posed problems
b. Data availability/scarcity and cleanliness
i. Basic data cleaning and preprocessing
ii. Data set bias
c. Algorithmic bias
d. Evaluation bias
e. Assessment of societal implications of the application
5. Additional depth on deployed deep generative models
a. Introduction to how deep image generative models work, (e.g., as of 2023, DALL-E, Midjourney,
Stable Diffusion) including discussion of attention
b. Introduction to how large language models work, (e.g., as of 2023, ChatGPT, Bard) including
discussion of attention
c. Idea of foundational models, how to use them, and the benefits/issues with training them from
big data
6. Analysis and discussion of the societal impact of AI
a. Ethics (See also: SEP-Context)
b. Fairness (See also: SEP-Privacy, SEP-DEIA)
c. Trust/explainability (See also: SEP-Context)
d. Privacy and usage of training data (See also: SEP-Privacy)
e. Human autonomy and oversight/regulations/legal requirements (See also: SEP-Context)
f. Sustainability (See also: SEP-Sustainability)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
1. Given a real-world application domain and problem, formulate an AI solution to it, identifying proper
data/input, preprocessing, representations, AI techniques, and evaluation metrics/methodology.
2. Analyze the societal impact of one or more specific real-world AI applications, identifying issues
regarding ethics, fairness, bias, trust, and explainability.
3. Describe some of the failure modes of current deep generative models for language or images, and
how this could affect their use in an application.
