DM-Modeling: Data Modeling
CS Core:
1. Data modeling (See also: SE-Requirements)
2. Relational data model (See also: MSF-Discrete)
KA Core:
3. Conceptual models (e.g., entity-relationship, UML diagrams)
4. Semi-structured data models (expressed using DTD, XML, or JSON Schema, for example)
Non-core:
5. Spreadsheet models
6. Object-oriented models (See also: FPL-OOP)
a. GraphQL
7. New features in SQL
8. Specialized Data Modeling topics
a. Time series data (aggregation, join)
b. Graph data (link traversal)
c. Techniques for avoiding inefficient raw data access (e.g., “avg daily price”): materialized views
and special data structures (e.g., Hyperloglog, bitmap)
d. Geo-Spatial data (e.g., GIS databases) (See also: SPD-Interactive)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
CS Core:
1. Describe the components of the relational data model.
2. Model 1:1, 1:n, and n:m relationships using the relational data model.
KA Core:
3. Describe the components of the E-R (or some other non-relational) data model.
4. Model a given environment using a conceptual data model.
5. Model a given environment using the document-based or key-value store-based data model.
