DM-NoSQL: NoSQL Systems
KA Core:
1. Why NoSQL? (e.g., Impedance mismatch between Application [CRUD] and RDBMS)
2. Key-Value and Document data model
Non-core:
3. Storage systems (e.g., Key-Value systems, Data Lakes)
4. Distribution Models (Sharding and Replication) (See also: PDC-Communication)
5. Graph Databases
6. Consistency Models (Update and Read, Quorum consistency, CAP theorem) (See also: PDC-
Communication)
7. Processing model (e.g., Map-Reduce, multi-stage map-reduce, incremental map-reduce) (See also:
PDC-Communication)
8. Case Studies: Cloud storage system (e.g., S3); Graph databases; “When not to use NoSQL” (See
also: SPD-Web)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
KA Core:
1. Develop a use case for the use of NoSQL over RDBMS.
2. Describe the defining characteristics behind Key-Value and Document-based data models.
