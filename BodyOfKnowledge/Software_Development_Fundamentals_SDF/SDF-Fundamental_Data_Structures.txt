CS Core: (See also: AL-Foundational) 
1. Standard abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, sets, and maps/dictionaries, including operations on them.   
2. Selecting and using appropriate data structures. 
3. Performance implications of choice of data structure(s). 
4. Strings and string processing.

Illustrative Learning Outcomes: 
CS Core: 
1. Write programs that use each of the key abstract data types provided in the language (e.g., arrays, tuples/records/structs, lists, stacks, queues, and associative data types like sets, dictionaries/maps). 
2. Select the appropriate data structure for a given problem.  
3. Explain how the performance of a program may change when using different data structures or operations. 
4. Write programs that work with text by using string processing capabilities provided by the language.
