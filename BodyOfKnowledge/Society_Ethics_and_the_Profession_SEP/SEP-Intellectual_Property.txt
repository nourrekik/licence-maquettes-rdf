Intellectual property refers to a range of intangible rights of ownership in any product of human intellect, such as a software program. Laws, which vary by locality, provide different methods for protecting these rights of ownership based on their type. Ideally, intellectual property laws balance the interests of creators and users of the property. There are four types of intellectual property rights relevant to software: patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks. Moreover, property rights are often protected by user licenses. Each affords a different type of legal protection.
