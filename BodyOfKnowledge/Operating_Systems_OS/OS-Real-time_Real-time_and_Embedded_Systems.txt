OS-Real-time: Real-time and Embedded Systems
KA Core:
1. Process and task scheduling.
2. Deadlines and real-time issues. (See also: SPD-Embedded)
3. Low-latency vs ‚Äùsoft real-time" vs "hard real time." (See also: SPD-Embedded, FPL-Event-Driven)
Non-Core:
4. Memory/disk management requirements in a real-time environment.
5. Failures, risks, and recovery.
6. Special concerns in real-time systems (safety).
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
KA Core:
1. Explain what makes a system a real-time system.
2. Explain latency and its sources in software systems and its characteristics.
3. Explain special concerns that real-time systems present, including risk, and how these concerns are
addressed.
Non-Core:
4. Explain specific real time operating systems features and mechanisms.
