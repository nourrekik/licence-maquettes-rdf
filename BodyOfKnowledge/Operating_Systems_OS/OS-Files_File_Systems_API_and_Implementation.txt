OS-Files: File Systems API and Implementation
KA Core:
1. Concept of a file including data, metadata, operations, and access-mode
2. File system mounting
3. File access control
4. File sharing
5. Basic file allocation methods, including linked allocation table
6. File system structures comprising file allocation including various directory structures and methods
for uniquely identifying files (e.g., name, identified or metadata storage location)
7. Allocation/deallocation/storage techniques (algorithms and data structure) impact on performance
and flexibility (i.e., internal and external fragmentation and compaction)
8. Free space management such as using bit tables vs linking
9. Implementation of directories to segment and track file location
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
KA Core:
1. Explain the choices to be made in designing file systems.
2. Evaluate different approaches to file organization, recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of
each.
3. Apply software constructs appropriately given knowledge of the file system implementation.
