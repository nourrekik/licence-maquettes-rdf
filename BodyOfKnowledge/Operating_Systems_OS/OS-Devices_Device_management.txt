OS-Devices: Device management
KA Core:
1. Buffering strategies (See also: AR-IO)
2. Direct Memory Access (DMA) and polled I/O, Memory-mapped I/O (See also: AR-IO)
Example concept: DMA communication protocols (e.g., ring buffers etc.)
3. Historical and contextual - Persistent storage device management (e.g., magnetic, Solid State
Device (SSD)) (See also: SEP-History)
Non-Core:
4. Device interface abstractions, hardware abstraction layer
5. Device driver purpose, abstraction, implementation, and testing challenges
6. High-level fault tolerance in device communication
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
KA Core:
1. Explain architecture level device control implementation and link relevant operating system
mechanisms and policy (e.g., buffering strategies, direct memory access).
2. Explain OS device management layers and the architecture (e.g., device controller, device driver,
device abstraction).
3. Explain the relationship between the physical hardware and the virtual devices maintained by the
operating system.
4. Explain I/O data buffering and describe strategies for implementing it.
5. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of direct memory access and discuss the
circumstances in which its use is warranted.
Non-Core:
6. Describe the complexity and best practices for the creation of device drivers.
