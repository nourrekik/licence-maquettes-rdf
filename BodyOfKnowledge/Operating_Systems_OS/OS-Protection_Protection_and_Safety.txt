OS-Protection: Protection and Safety
CS Core:
1. Overview of operating system security mechanisms (See also: SEC-Foundations)
2. Attacks and antagonism (scheduling, etc.) (See also: SEC-Foundations)
3. Review of major vulnerabilities in real operating systems (See also: SEC-Foundations)
4. Operating systems mitigation strategies such as backups (See also: SF-Reliability)
KA Core:
5. Policy/mechanism separation (See also: SEC-Governance)
6. Security methods and devices (See also: SEC-Foundations)
 Example concepts:
a. Rings of protection (history from Multics to virtualized x86)
b. x86_64 rings -1 and -2 (hypervisor and ME/PSP)
7. Protection, access control, and authentication (See also: SEC-Foundations, SEC-Crypto)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
CS Core:
1. Understand the requirement for protection and security mechanisms in operating systems.
2. List and describe the attack vectors that leverage OS vulnerabilities.
3. Understand the mechanisms available in an OS to control access to resources.
KA Core:
4. Summarize the features and limitations of an operating system that impact protection and security.
