NC-Applications: Networked Applications
CS Core:
1. Naming and address schemes (e.g., DNS, and Uniform Resource Identifiers)
2. Distributed application paradigms (e.g., client/server, peer-to-peer, cloud, edge, and fog) (See also:
PDC-Communication, PDC-Coordination)
3. Diversity of networked application demands (e.g., latency, bandwidth, and loss tolerance) (See
also: PDC-Communication, SEP-Sustainability, SEP-Context)
4. Coverage of application-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP)
5. Interactions with TCP, UDP, and Socket APIs (See also: PDC-Programs)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
CS Core:
1. Define the principles of naming, addressing, resource location.
2. Analyze the needs of specific networked application demands.
3. Describe the details of one application layer protocol.
4. Implement a simple client-server socket-based application.
