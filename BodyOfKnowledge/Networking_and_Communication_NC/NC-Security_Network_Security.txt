NC-Security: Network Security
KA Core:
1. General intro about security (Threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures) (See also: SEPSecurity, SEC-Foundations, SEC-Engineering)
2. Network specific threats and attack types (e.g., denial of service, spoofing, sniffing and traffic
redirection, attacker-in-the-middle, message integrity attacks, routing attacks, ransomware, and
traffic analysis) (See also: SEC-Foundations, SEC-Engineering)
3. Countermeasures (: SEC-Foundations, SEC-Crypto, SEC-Engineering)
a. Cryptography (e.g. SSL, TLS, symmetric/asymmetric)
b. Architectures for secure networks (e.g., secure channels, secure routing protocols, secure
DNS, VPNs, DMZ, Zero Trust Network Access, hyper network security, anonymous
communication protocols, isolation)
c. Network monitoring, intrusion detection, firewalls, spoofing and DoS protection, honeypots,
tracebacks, BGP Sec, RPKI
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
KA Core:
1. Describe some of the threat models of network security. 
2. Describe specific network-based countermeasures.
3. Analyze various aspects of network security from a case study.
