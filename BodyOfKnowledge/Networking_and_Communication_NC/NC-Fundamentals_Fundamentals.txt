NC-Fundamentals: Fundamentals
CS Core:
1. Importance of networking in contemporary computing, and associated challenges. (See also: SEPContext, SEP-Privacy)
2. Organization of the internet (e.g., users, Internet Service Providers, autonomous systems, content
providers, content delivery networks)
3. Switching techniques (e.g., circuit and packet)
4. Layers and their roles (application, transport, network, datalink, and physical)
5. Layering principles (e.g., encapsulation and hourglass model) (See also: SF-Foundations)
6. Network elements (e.g., routers, switches, hubs, access points, and hosts)
7. Basic queueing concepts (e.g., relationship with latency, congestion, service levels, etc.)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
CS Core:
1. Articulate the organization of the internet.
2. List and define the appropriate network terminology
3. Describe the layered structure of a typical networked architecture.
4. Identify the different types of complexity in a network (edges, core, etc.).
