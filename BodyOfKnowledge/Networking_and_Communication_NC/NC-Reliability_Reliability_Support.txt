NC-Reliability: Reliability Support
KA Core:
1. Unreliable delivery (e.g., UDP)
2. Principles of reliability (e.g., delivery without loss, duplication, or out of order) (See also: SFReliability)
3. Error control (e.g., retransmission, error correction)
4. Flow control (e.g., stop and wait, window based)
5. Congestion control (e.g., implicit and explicit congestion notification)
6. TCP and performance issues (e.g., Tahoe, Reno, Vegas, Cubic)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
KA Core:
1. Describe the operation of reliable delivery protocols.
2. List the factors that affect the performance of reliable delivery protocols.
3. Describe some TCP reliability design issues.
4. Design and implement a simple reliable protocol.
