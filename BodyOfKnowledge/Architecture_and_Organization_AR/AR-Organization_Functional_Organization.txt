AR-Organization: Functional Organization
KA Core:
1. Implementation of simple datapaths, including instruction pipelining, hazard detection, and
resolution (e.g., stalls, forwarding)
2. Control unit
a. Hardwired implementation
b. Microprogrammed realization
3. Instruction pipelining (See also: SF-Overview)
4. Introduction to instruction-level parallelism (ILP) (See also: PDC-Programs)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
KA Core:
1. Compare alternative implementation of datapaths in modern computer architectures.
2. Produce a set of control signals for adding two integers using hardwired and microprogrammed
implementations.
3. Discuss instruction-level parallelism using pipelining and significant hazards that may occur.
4. Design a complete processor, including datapath and control.
5. Compute the average cycles per instruction for a given processor and memory system
implementation.
