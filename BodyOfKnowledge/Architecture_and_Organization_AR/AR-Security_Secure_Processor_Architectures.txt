Illustrative Learning Outcomes
KA Core:
1. Discuss principles of secure hardware, exploring a framework for risk analysis and asset protection.
2. Summarize how Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) can be a unique device identifier in security
applications.
3. Distinguish a random number generator with dedicated hardware support from generators without
hardware dedicated to generating entropy.
4. List the advantages and disadvantages of memory protection at the ISA level.
5. Describe key design issues of a trusted execution environment (TEE) to support virtual machines.
