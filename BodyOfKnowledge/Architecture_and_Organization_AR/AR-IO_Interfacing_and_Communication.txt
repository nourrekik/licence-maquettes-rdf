a. Handshaking and buffering
b. Programmed I/O
c. Interrupt-driven I/O (See also: OS-Principles)
2. Interrupt structures: vectored and prioritized, interrupt acknowledgment (See also: OS-Principles)
3. I/O devices (e.g., mouse, keyboard, display, camera, sensors, actuators) (See also: GIT-
Fundamentals, GIT-Interaction, OS-Advanced-Files, PDC-Programs)

b. Arbitration
c. Direct-memory access (DMA)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
CS Core:
1. Analyze an interrupt control diagram to comment on how interrupts are used to implement I/O
control and data transfers.
2. Enumerate various types of buses in a computer system.
3. List the advantages of magnetic disks and contrast them with those of solid-state disks.
