AR-Memory: Memory Hierarchy
CS Core:
1. Memory hierarchy: the importance of temporal and spatial locality (See also: SF-Performance, OS-
Memory)
2. Main memory organization and operations (See also: OS-Memory)
3. Persistent memory (e.g., SSD, standard disks)
4. Latency, cycle time, bandwidth, and interleaving (See also: SF-Performance)
5. Cache memories (See also: SF-Performance)
a. Address mapping
b. Block size

c. Replacement and store policy
d. Prefetching
6. Multiprocessor cache coherence (See also: OS-Scheduling)
7. Virtual memory (hardware support) (See also: OS-Memory)
8. Fault handling and reliability (See also: SF-Reliability)
9. Reliability (See also: SF-Reliability, OS-Faults)
a. Error coding
b. Data compression
c. Data integrity
KA Core:
10. Processing In-Memory (PIM)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
CS Core:
1. Using a memory system diagram, identify the main types of memory technology (e.g., SRAM,
DRAM) and their relative cost and performance.
2. Measure the effect of memory latency on running time.
3. Enumerate the functions of a system with virtual memory management.
4. Compute average memory access time under various cache and memory configurations and mixes
of instruction and data references.
