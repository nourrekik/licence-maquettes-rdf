Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
103
KA Core:
1. Discuss the progression of computer technology components from vacuum tubes to VLSI, from
mainframe computer architectures to the organization of warehouse-scale computers.
2. Describe parallelism and data dependencies between and within components in a modern
heterogeneous computer architecture.
3. Explain the relationship between parallelism and power consumption.
4. Construct the design of basic building blocks for a computer: arithmetic-logic unit (gate-level),
registers (gate-level), central processing unit (register transfer-level), and memory (register transfer-
level).
5. Evaluate simple building blocks (e.g., arithmetic-logic unit, registers, movement between registers)
of a simple computer design.
6. Analyze the timing behavior of a pipelined processor, identifying data dependency issues.
