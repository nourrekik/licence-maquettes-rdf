AR-Representation: Machine-Level Data Representation
CS Core:
1. Overview and history of computer architecture (See also: SPD-Game)
2. Bits, bytes, and words
3. Unsigned, signed and two’s complement representations
4. Numeric data representation and number bases
a. Fixed-point
b. Floating-point
5. Representation of non-numeric data
6. Representation of records, arrays and UTF data types (See also: AL-Foundational)
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
CS Core:
1. Discuss why everything in computers are data, including instructions.
2. Explain how fixed-length number representations can affect accuracy and precision.
3. Describe how negative integers are stored in sign-magnitude and two’s-complement
representations.
4. Discuss how different formats can represent numerical data.
5. Explain the bit-level representation of non-numeric data, such as characters, strings, records, and
arrays.
6. Translate numerical data from one format to another.
7. Describe how a single adder (without overflow detection) can handle both signed (two’s
complement) and unsigned (binary) input without “knowing” which format a given input is using.
