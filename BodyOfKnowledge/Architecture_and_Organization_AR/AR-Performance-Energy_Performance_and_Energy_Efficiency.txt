AR-Performance-Energy: Performance and Energy Efficiency
KA Core:
1. Performance-energy evaluation (introduction): performance, power consumption, memory, and
communication costs (See also: SF-Evaluation, OS-Scheduling, SPD-Game)
2. Branch prediction, speculative execution, out-of-order execution, Tomasulo's algorithm
3. Enhancements for vector processors and GPUs (See also: SPD-Game)
4. Hardware support for multithreading (See also: OS-Concurrency, OS-Scheduling, PDC-Programs)
a. Race conditions
b. Lock implementations
c. Point-to-point synchronization
d. Barrier implementation
5. Scalability
6. Alternative architectures including VLIW/EPIC, accelerators, and other special purpose processors
7. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)
8. Dark Silicon
Illustrative Learning Outcomes:
KA Core:
1. Discuss performance and energy efficiency evaluation metrics.
2. Analyze a speculative execution diagram and write about the decisions that can be made.
3. Create a GPU performance-watt benchmarking diagram.
4. Write a multithreaded program that adds (in parallel) elements of two integer vectors.
5. Recommend a set of design choices for alternative computer architectures.

6. Enumerate key concepts associated with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.
7. Measure energy savings improvement for an 8-bit integer quantization compared to a 32-bit
quantization.
