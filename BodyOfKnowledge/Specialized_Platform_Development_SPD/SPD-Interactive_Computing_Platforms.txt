Illustrative Learning Outcomes: 
Non-core: 
1. Analyze large datasets interactively. 
2. Create a backing track for a musical performance, such as live coding. 
3. Create compelling computational notebooks that construct a narrative for a given journalistic goal/story. 
4. Implement interactive code that uses a dataset and generates exploratory graphics. 
5. Create a program that performs a task using LLM systems. 
6. Contrast a program developed by an AI platform and by a human. 
7. Implement a system that interacts with a human without using a screen. 
8. Contextualize the attributes of different data analysis styles, such as interactive vs engineered pipeline. 
9. Write a program using a notebook computing platform (e.g., searching, sorting, or graph manipulation). 
10. Demonstrate a quantum gate outcome using a quantum platform.
