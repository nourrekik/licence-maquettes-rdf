FPL-Syntax: Syntax Analysis
Non-core:
1. Regular grammars vs context-free grammars (See also: AL-Models)
2. Scanning and parsing based on language specifications
3. Lexical analysis using regular expressions
4. Tokens and their use
5. Parsing strategies including top-down (e.g., recursive descent, or LL) and bottom-up (e.g., LR or
GLR) techniques
a. Lookahead tables and their application to parsing
6. Language theory:
a. Chomsky hierarchy (See also: AL-Models)
b. Left-most/right-most derivation and ambiguity
c. Grammar transformation
7. Parser error recovery mechanisms
8. Generating scanners and parsers from declarative specifications
Illustrative learning outcomes:
Non-core:
1. Use formal grammars to specify the syntax of languages.
2. Illustrate the role of lookahead tables in parsing.
3. Use declarative tools to generate parsers and scanners.
4. Recognize key issues in syntax definitions: ambiguity, associativity, precedence.
