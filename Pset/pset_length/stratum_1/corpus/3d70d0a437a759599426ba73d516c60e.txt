##  Barsana, Uttar Pradesh: Holi with Sticks

![Hindus Celebrate Holi In
India](https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/PM_67_jAOj1kvnxTamlZVTk0l4Y=/1280x853/filters:no_upscale\(\):max_bytes\(150000\):strip_icc\(\)/164288808-56a3be0a5f9b58b7d0d3922e.jpg)

Indian men don't always rule the roost! The women of Barsana and Nandgaon
villages near Mathura in Uttar Pradesh beat up men with sticks, in what's
known as Lathmar Holi celebrations. Unfortunately, this event isn't
recommended for solo female travelers due to the [disgusting behavior of
men](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/holi-molestation-lath-maar-holi/), who
continue to go around molesting women.

  * **Dates:** Lathmar Holi takes place in the week before the main day of Holi. In 2021, it will happen on March 23 in Barsana and March 24 in Nandgaon. It's worth getting to Barsana a couple of days before Lathmar Holi so that you can also experience Laddoo Holi festivities there at Shriji Temple on March 22. Sweets are thrown around and spiritual songs related to Radha and Krishna are sung.
  * **Tours:**  [DCP Expeditions](http://www.dcpexpeditions.com/) conducts an annual four-day photography tour covering all the events. Agra beat conducts [day tours](http://agrabeat.com/holitours.html) to Barsana and Nandgaon from Agra. In addition, [1100 Walks](http://1100walks.com/) usually runs a day trip to Barsana from Delhi.

Holi celebrations get underway on [Vasant Panchami (end of
winter)](https://www.tripsavvy.com/the-spring-festivals-in-india-3888032), 40
days before the main Holi day, in the temple towns of [Mathura and
Vrindavan](https://www.tripsavvy.com/best-hotels-in-mathura-and-vrindavan-for-
all-budgets-1539393), four hours from Delhi. Mathura is where Lord Krishna was
born, while Vrindavan was where he spent his childhood.

  * **Dates:** [Sri Krishna Janmasthan temple](http://uptourism.gov.in/post/krishna-janmasthan-temple) in Mathura holds a renowned show in the week before Holi. The week long celebrations at [Banke Bihari temple](https://bihariji.org/festival.php) in Vrindavan are also legendary, and culminate with the throwing of colors in the morning on the day before Holi (March 28, 2021). The celebrations start with the throwing of flowers (Phoolon Wali Holi) at 4 p.m. on March 25, 2021. Widows play Holi in Vrindavan on March 27, 2021. In the afternoon on March 28, head to Mathura for the colorful Holi procession that commences at around 3. p.m. from Vishram Ghat and finishes near Holi Gate. On Holi (March 29, 2021), the best place to catch the throwing of colors is Dwarkadheesh Temple in Mathura. Start the day early (at around 7 a.m) at Vishram Ghat to see priests making _bhang._ The day after Holi, March 30, 2021, women gather to beat AND strip men at Daoji temple in Baldeo (45 minutes from Mathura). The action gets underway around noon but arrive by 10 a.m. to secure a good vantage point.
  * **Tours:** For safety reasons, it's highly recommended that women go on a guided tour such as [those tours offered by Agra Beat.](http://agrabeat.com/holitours.html)

The celebration of Holi as Basanta Utsav (Spring Festival) in
[Shantiniketan](https://www.tripsavvy.com/places-to-visit-in-west-
bengal-1539740) was started by famous Bengali poet and Nobel Laureate
Rabindranath Tagore. Inspired by spring and the colors of Holi, he introduced
the occasion as an annual event in his [Vishva Bharati
University](http://www.visva-bharati.ac.in/) there. Students dress up in
spring colors and put on a huge cultural program for visitors, including
dances to Tagore's songs. This is followed by the usual throwing of colors.
Three days of festivities, featuring local folk performances and food, also
take place at a theater village at Tepantar near Shantiniketan. Basanta Utsav
has become a cherished part of Bengali history and culture, and it attracts
many foreign tourists.

  * **Date:** March 28-29, 2021.

and play Holi with the locals, as well as enjoy a wide variety of unique folk
art. This includes the remarkable Chau dance, Darbari Jhumur, Natua dance, and
songs of West Bengal's wandering Baul musicians. What makes the festival
special is that it's organized by villagers as a way of helping sustain
themselves. The location is around [five to six hours by train from
Kolkata](https://www.tripsavvy.com/information-about-kolkata-1539214), or
transport in private vehicles can be arranged. Accommodation is provided in

Mohalla is an annual fair that dates all the way back to 1701. It was first
organized by Sikh Guru Gobind Singh to celebrate Holi. However, instead of

wrestling, martial arts, mock sword fights, acrobatic military exercises, and
turban tying.

will be a magnificent palace procession from the royal residence to Manek

[Dharavi, Mumbai's largest slum](https://www.tripsavvy.com/mumbai-dharavi-
slum-tours-4072927), is not the depressing place that you may expect it to be
-- and especially so on Holi. Reality Tours and Travel will take you on a
fascinating (and uplifting) tour of the slum, and then to a Holi party that
they will be throwing for the community at Dharavi. Join in and celebrate Holi
with the locals in a safe and friendly environment, complete with colors and
music. The cost is 1,400 rupees per person. 80% of proceeds are devoted to
helping the people of Dharavi.

If you're in Delhi, Reality Tours and Travel organizes a [similar Holi event
in Sanjay Colony](http://realitytoursandtravel.com/tour/sanjay-holi-tour/).

  * **Date:** To be announced. Usually a couple of days before Holi.

Holi tends to be a rowdy affair in Delhi. If you're staying anywhere near
Paharganj, be prepared to be covered in color by shopkeepers and children
alike if you step outside. If you can, try and get tickets to the Holi Moo
Festival (previously the renowned Holi Cow Festival). This festival of color,
moozik and madness has more than 40 Indian and international performers spread
over four stages. The environment is safe, and non-toxic colors are provided,
along with _bhang lassi_ , street food, and sprinklers to get everyone in the
mood. Plenty of expats, as well as locals, attend. You can find out more about
[Holi Moo on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/holimoofestival/).

If you're looking for an exuberant Holi, South India is generally best
avoided. As Holi is primarily a North Indian festival, it's quite subdued at
most places in the south. The focus is mainly on religious aspects and temple
rites. However, [Hampi in Karnataka](https://www.tripsavvy.com/essential-
travel-guide-for-hampi-1539342) is a notable exception! The whole town turns
out to play Holi in the morning (perhaps for the benefit of the many western
travelers there), amid drumming, dancing, and the evocative ruins of the grand
Vijayanagar empire. Afterwards, the crowd slowly moves to the river to wash
all the color off.

  * **Date:** March 29, 2021.
