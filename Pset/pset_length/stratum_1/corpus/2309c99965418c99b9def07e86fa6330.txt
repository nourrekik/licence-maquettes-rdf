First birthdays are such incredible events because babies become actual people
in that short time frame. And so it happens that our princess turned one in
November - would you believe it?

I made princess a super cute first birthday hat from felt, but I turned it
into a headband so that it would feel natural to her. She is used to wearing
headbands (she has[ this amazing baby headband holder
](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/diy-baby-headband-holder/)that I made for
her, with over 70 to choose from). So I created something that didn't feel too
different and that looked so so cute.

The result is not only adorable but it really stayed on for most of the party
- never mind the photo shoot! You can customize the colors to suit any scheme
or theme. I used a [dark teal sheet](https://rstyle.me/+omPTwv2BdD-
qkzvzc3yjKg) of thick felt along with cream colored sparkly tulle to go both
with our modern rainbow theme and [her
outfit](https://rstyle.me/+wdgX3_Xh6FwdZe97Ew0JdQ).

content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-final-2.jpg)

On that note, this DIY first birthday hat is the first in a series where I'll
be sharing all about A's birthday! Just to note, I tend to go frugal rather
than Pinterest-perfect for my parties. I don't do elaborate sweet tables - I
just try to keep things tasteful, coordinated, and well-planned.

With ongoing experience, I am getting better at it, but I hope you'll still
find my breakdown of ideas to be realistic rather than overly aspirational. In
any case, obviously, you should do what works best for you and what makes the
most sense for your budget and skill levels. This party is for _you_ not for
your baby. So do what'll make you happy.

For me, that's being creative. For you it might be ordering in pizza. The main
goal is to celebrate your child's life in a way that'll truly feel like a
celebration to you.

## How to make a first birthday hat that stays on and is comfortable

1\. Trace your plate and make a roughly 7 inch circle.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-1.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20658'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='658'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-1.jpg)

2\. Measure a line on the radius of the circle (half the width/diameter).

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-2.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20750'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='750'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-2.jpg)

3\. Cut off a bit more than half of the circle. It doesn't have to be exact -
you'll be able to play with the shape in the next step and make a larger or
smaller seam as you'd like.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-3.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20670'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='670'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-3.jpg)

4\. Fold it in half and glue the straight edge together to form a seam. Make
sure the cone is in a proportion that you like.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-3b.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20817'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='817'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-3b.jpg)

5\. When it dries, trim the seam if necessary and turn your hat right side
out.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-4.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20803'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='803'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-4.jpg)

6\. Trim around the base.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-5.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20573'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='573'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-5.jpg)

7\. Make your pom pom. Mine was deliberately oversized in proportion to the
hat. Tulle is a lightweight material so it can handle it. I used a different
method however I recommend you learn [how to make a pom pom with tulle
here](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/how-to-make-a-pom-pom-with-tulle/) and
use that method.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-6.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20778'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='778'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-6.jpg)

8\. Place some glue on the tip of the cone and attach it to the core of the
pom pom.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-7.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20533'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='533'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-7.jpg)

9\. If you'd like to add a tulle border, twist a piece around the base, gluing
as you go along. Rustic lace can look fabulous here as well.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-8.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20709'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='709'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-8.jpg)

10\. Trace a circle a tiny bit smaller (like 1mm) than the base of your cone.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-9.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%201081'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='1081'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-9.jpg)

11\. And glue it to the base of your first birthday hat.

[![](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/first-
birthday-hat-
step-10.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20758'%3E%3Crect%20width='800'%20height='758'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/04/first-birthday-hat-step-10.jpg)

12\. Attach an elastic to fit around your baby's head and cover it with a
smaller piece of felt to hide the elastic seam. This makes it more comfortable
to wear too.

## DIY First Birthday Hat for Girls

Print

### Materials

  * [Good, thick felt sheet](https://www.dickblick.com/items/kunin-premium-felt-charcoal-9-x-12/?SSAID=992277&sscid=41k6_qkrtb&utm_source=SAS&utm_medium=affiliates&ref=affiliates)
  * [Tulle ribbon](https://amzn.to/3Kj5mAy)
  * [1/4 inch flat elastic](https://amzn.to/3Lbtarx)

### Tools

  * [6-7 inch round plate to trace](https://amzn.to/3xR1JPW)
  * [Ruler](https://rstyle.me/+U1oBJQQeFfr3X89xmSQ2rg)
  * [Tailor's chalk](https://rstyle.me/+8vuvqWd9BVVQ-koV8ibL4g)
  * [Fabric scissors](https://rstyle.me/+ec_J0MQ-ZKlLarCTRCiDPg)
  * [Hot glue gun](https://amzn.to/3xOJryt)

### Instructions

1\. Trace your plate and make a roughly 7 inch circle.

2\. Measure a line on the radius of the circle (half the width/diameter).

3\. Cut off a bit more than half of the circle. It doesn't have to be exact -
you'll be able to play with the shape in the next step and make a larger or
smaller seam as you'd like.

4\. Fold it in half and glue the straight edge together to form a seam. Make
sure the cone is in a proportion that you like.

5\. When it dries, trim the seam if necessary and turn your hat right side
out.

6\. Trim around the base.

7\. Make your pom pom. Mine was deliberately oversized in proportion to the
hat. Tulle is a lightweight material so it can handle it. I used a different
method however I recommend you learn [how to make a pom pom with tulle
here](https://www.momsandcrafters.com/how-to-make-a-pom-pom-with-tulle/) and
use that method.

8\. Place some glue on the tip of the cone and attach it to the core of the
pom pom.

9\. If you'd like to add a tulle border, twist a piece around the base, gluing
as you go along. Rustic lace can look fabulous here as well.

10\. Trace a circle a tiny bit smaller (like 1mm) than the base of your cone.

11\. And glue it to the base of your first birthday hat.

12\. Attach an elastic to fit around your baby's head and cover it with a
smaller piece of felt to hide the elastic seam. This makes it more comfortable
to wear too.
