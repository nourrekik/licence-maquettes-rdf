#  Water immersion technology and high-content imaging: A closer look

  * __ November 20, 2020
  * __ Tim Baranowski 

Three-dimensional (3D) cellular assays have emerged as a valuable tool in drug
discovery and biological research, as they closely mimic _in vivo_
environments and are shown to generate more physiologically relevant data than
many 2D assays. With the increased utilization of 3D cultures for phenotypic
screening and toxicity assessment, there is a growing need to optimize assay
sensitivity, resolution, and throughput.

Here, we explore how high-performance water immersion objectives on the
[ImageXpress® Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging
System](https://www.moleculardevices.com/products/cellular-imaging-
systems/high-content-imaging/imagexpress-micro-
confocal?_ga=2.172904682.8314759.1604897083-1339055989.1603118264#Overview)
facilitate these growing demands by enhancing the sensitivity, resolution and
throughput for complex 3D structures such as spheroids, organoids, and organ-
on-a-chip biology.

![Water immersion technology](/sites/default/files/inline-images/water-
immersion-technology.png)

### What is water immersion technology?

In terms of high-content imaging, [water immersion
technology](/technology/water-immersion-objectives) automatically and
consistently places a layer of water between the objective (magnification) and
the sample.

Many [cellular imaging
systems](https://www.moleculardevices.com/products/cellular-imaging-systems)
are designed to have air between the objective and the sample. When using air
objectives for 3D imaging, a significant portion of the fluorescent light that
is emitted from a sample is refracted away from the objective and becomes
lost. This reduces the signal that is collected from the sample, and causes
the sample to appear distorted. Oil objectives have been the gold standard for
3D [confocal imaging](https://www.moleculardevices.com/products/cellular-
imaging-systems/high-content-imaging/imagexpress-micro-confocal), because they
collect more light from the sample, which increases the signal intensity and
enhances the image resolution. However, oil objectives are still problematic,
as oil can be difficult to handle in an automated fashion and these objectives
can also cause some distortion when imaging large 3D samples.

![Water immersion technology](/sites/default/files/inline-images/water-
immersion-technology-image.png)

### Achieve greater sensitivity and resolution without sacrificing speed

Compared to air objectives, water immersion objectives have a higher numerical
aperture, allowing them to collect more light from the sample. This increases
image intensities by up to four times and minimizes distortion, providing a
more accurate representation of the sample shape. In simple terms, cells exist
in water. By placing water between the objective and the sample, you are
better able to match the cellular environment and produce a higher quality
image.

![sensitivity and resolution without sacrificing
speed](/sites/default/files/inline-images/sensitivity-and-resolution-without-
sacrificing-speed.png)

Water immersion objectives also take a much finer z-slice of a 3D image in
comparison to dry objectives (higher NA). And because of the increased light
collection, they produce sharper, crisper images with finer cellular detail.

detail.png)

Because the water immersion objective collects a higher signal from the
sample, you are able to decrease your exposure time and thus increase the
speed of the acquisition. Alternately, you may choose to maintain a higher
exposure time and acquire even brighter images.

### Gain deeper insight into thicker 3D samples

The [ImageXpress Micro Confocal system](/products/cellular-imaging-
systems/high-content-imaging/imagexpress-micro-
confocal?_ga=2.186539488.8314759.1604897083-1339055989.1603118264) includes a
[Deep Tissue confocal disk module and laser illumination
options](/products/cellular-imaging-systems/high-content-imaging/imagexpress-
micro-confocal#options) that can be combined with water immersion objectives
to help you image even deeper into 3D samples. The thicker the sample, the
more likely you are to experience pinhole crosstalk, contamination that is
produced by the surrounding light, which results in haze and reduced image
quality. The Deep Tissue confocal disk module is designed to minimize the
crosstalk between pinholes and remove haze so that you can image deeper into
the sample.

### How water immersion works on the ImageXpress Micro Confocal system

The technology consists of two bottles, a diaphragm pump, and an adapter for
the objective. The pump sends pressure into the source bottle and pushes water
to the objective. As the imaging occurs, water rolls off the objective and
gets pulled back through via the vacuum created by the pump. [MetaXpress®
software](/products/cellular-imaging-systems/acquisition-and-analysis-
software/metaxpress) automatically refills the water within milliseconds, as
needed, for a seamless experience.

The water immersion objectives are field upgradeable and can be easily
implemented with minimal changes to an existing workflow. When you first turn
on the system, or transition from an air objective to a water objective, it
takes only a few minutes for the water to move onto the objective so that
imaging can begin.

Sensors are built into the water controller system to detect faults (e.g.,
leaks) and monitor system health. The system is designed to automatically
supply and maintain water to the objective, making the setup and operation
seamless for the user. The software also provides user-friendly alerts when it
is time to refill the bottles, which typically need to be refilled once a
week, depending on the types of samples that are being run.

### Don’t overlook your 2D samples

When considering water immersion objectives for high-content imaging, your 2D
samples should not be overlooked. Water immersion objectives can also be very
useful for 2D imaging, especially if you need to examine fine features, such
as cytoskeletal filaments. If you have an assay in which the fluorescence is
very weak, water immersion can be used to help boost the signal as much as
possible.

You also have the ability to decrease your exposure time with 2D samples,
which will allow you to image your plate faster.
