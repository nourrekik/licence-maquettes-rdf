I have worked with TrustHome Properties for over 10 years now which should
tell you all you need to know as there is nothing like time for the true test
of consistantly delivering. I am an overseas landlord so having peace of mind
that you are in good hands in paramount. More recently I have been working
with Michelle Gutierrez who has done a great and timely job in finding
qualified and suitable tenants for the my investment property which is always
important to keep the investment income ticking over. On the properjty
management side I have been working with Regina Salgado who has also been
excellent in managing some fairly unique and quite often obscure problems at
the property. These were mainly around maintenance issues and needed some
thought to get to the bottom in order to avoid excessive numbers of
contractors and invoices and grateful for taking that personal approach. Thank
you to both of you!

We have recently changed our property management to TrustHome, and am more
than pleased that they have found us a credible tenant paying around 20% more
for our rental in Kissimmee. We have Michelle to thank for doing such
excellent work! 🙏🙏 Our former tenant who was approved by our former property
manager never paid their rent on time… we would sweat and worry every month,
moreover, this property management company charged us a full month’s rent for
finding us these tenants. Needless to say, TrustHome does give us peace of
mind with their professional service.

I had a previous management company by the name of great Jones and they were
anything but great they had my property six weeks and in those six weeks there
was very little communication there were no showings no applications and so I
decided to change management companies I researched several companies I got a
call from TrustHome and I liked that they were straightforward transparent
very excited about renting my property upon inspection of my property they
couldn't understand why it hadn't been rented being that it was such a
beautiful property William Rojas and Stephanie Melendez were just awesome
awesome in the process of getting my property rented they officially took over
on February 3rd and by February 12th I had 2 I applicants and I now have a
tenant which I'm very excited about and they have moved in and they are very
satisfied with the property my only regret is that I didn't sign with
TrustHome first then I would have had a tenant maybe as far back as January
and thanks to their due diligence I am now officially a landlord and I
couldn't be happier with TrustHome and I highly recommend them they just blew
my mind with their honesty communication phone calls updates to make sure I
was well-informed and how the process was going plus I got a fair market value
on the rent so I give TrustHome five stars to thumbs up

I have worked with TrustHome Properties for over 10 years now which should
tell you all you need to know as there is nothing like time for the true test
of consistantly delivering. I am an overseas landlord so having peace of mind
that you are in good hands in paramount. More recently I have been working
with Michelle Gutierrez who has done a great and timely job in finding
qualified and suitable tenants for the my investment property which is always
important to keep the investment income ticking over. On the properjty
management side I have been working with Regina Salgado who has also been
excellent in managing some fairly unique and quite often obscure problems at
the property. These were mainly around maintenance issues and needed some
thought to get to the bottom in order to avoid excessive numbers of
contractors and invoices and grateful for taking that personal approach. Thank
you to both of you!

Stacey & Michelle have been managing my property for over 1 year now. The
communication and service they have provided are night and day compared to my
previous leasing agency. They have been above and beyond my expectations and
I'm extremely happy I decided to move leasing companies to Trusthome.

We have recently changed our property management to TrustHome, and am more
than pleased that they have found us a credible tenant paying around 20% more
for our rental in Kissimmee. We have Michelle to thank for doing such
excellent work! 🙏🙏 Our former tenant who was approved by our former property
manager never paid their rent on time… we would sweat and worry every month,
moreover, this property management company charged us a full month’s rent for
finding us these tenants. Needless to say, TrustHome does give us peace of
mind with their professional service.
