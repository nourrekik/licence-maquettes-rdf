# Pool Resurfacing in Washington

## Pool Resurfacing in Washington

Pool finishes don’t last forever. Depending on the finish, yours may last
longer than some others. But eventually, every pool’s finish will wear away.
This is where
[Glasscoat](https://glasscoatpoolresurfacing.com/glasscoat/glasscoat-pool-
coatings/) comes in.

When it’s time to resurface, there are more options now than there have ever
been. Plaster was once the standard material, then fiberglass became the
option of choice, BUT now there’s a better option that’s gaining traction:
Glasscoat. Plaster pools are hard to resurface—the repairs are hard to get
right, and can sometimes peel away within a relatively short time. Even the
color of the [pool resurfacing](https://glasscoatpoolresurfacing.com/)
material can wind up different, making your pool look mottled or blotchy.

When plaster is applied badly, it can be in layers as thin as ⅛ of an inch.
That means that within 3 to 5 years there can be pop-offs, spalling and other
surface problems. The National Plasterers Council has devoted a great deal of
time and effort to studying the issues that come with resurfacing plaster,
since it’s been a legitimate issue for a while. That’s why Glasscoat is the
material of choice for commercial pools.

In commercial applications, Glasscoat installation or resurfacing pays for
itself because of lower maintenance costs, less pool chemicals needed and more
durability. Now Glasscoat is starting to catch on in residential applications
too.

## What’s the Difference?

The question then becomes “why use plaster”? Well frankly, there's no good
answer. Glasscoat is simply the best choice for pool resurfacing. Glasscoat
is:

  * Much longer service life than competing materials.
  * Virtually no periodic maintenance.
  * Better warranty compared to competing materials.

### Cement-based plaster finishes break down over time

Traditionally, cement-based plaster finishes have been used. Unfortunately,
plaster surfaces are porous and break down in pool water over time – becoming
spalled, rough, and stained.

### Glasscoat is the Premium Product!

Glasscoat is held to specific industry standards and has a higher baseline for
quality. Many people make their choice solely short-term factors. But long-
term, Glasscoat is a better choice across the board. When Spray-Tec Glasscoat
