# Commercial PilotPierre-Yves Wehr

I am an ambitious commercial pilot with more than four years and 300+ hours of
training and flying experience, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Aviation
Management.

My experience in customer service and passenger relations serves me well for a
job in any industry. I am a hard worker and a fast learner with many interests
and skills in and out of the field of aviation. I am prepared to start my
career as we enter this new age of aviation and look forward to any future
opportunities that may arise.
